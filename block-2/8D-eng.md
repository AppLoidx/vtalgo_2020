#### 1E

Now I am reading a book "A Returner's Magic Should Be Special". It is fantasy story with magic and other things, but it is really exiting story. Story starts with the end of journey of 6 most strongest wizards, but all another wizards (about 1.5 million) died. 

In the end, they lose their last fight with dragon, but main character is returned to past to the time, when he enrolled in magic academy. It is about 13 years ago.

And about 3 years before the Shadow Labyrinth starts  - the deadliest catastrophe humanity has ever known.

He said: "Now that I'm back, I won't allow my loved ones to die again!" and started his journey again.
